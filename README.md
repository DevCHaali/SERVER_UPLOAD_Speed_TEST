# Flask File Upload API

This is a simple Flask-based API that allows users to upload files to a server. The API supports multiple file types, including images and documents. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled to allow requests from any origin.

## Features

- Supports file uploads with a maximum size of 16 MB.
- Accepts files with the following extensions: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `pdf`, `py`.
- Stores uploaded files in the `uploads` directory.
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for success or error cases.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create the `uploads` directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir uploads
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Upload a file:**

   - Send a `POST` request to `/upload` with a file using a tool like Postman or `curl`:

     ```bash
     curl -X POST -F 'file=@/path/to/your/file.png' http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload
     ```

   - The API will return a success message if the file is valid and successfully uploaded:

     ```json
     {
       "message": "File uploaded successfully"
     }
     ```

   - If there is an error, the API will return an appropriate error message and HTTP status code.

## API Endpoints

### POST `/upload`

- **Description:** Upload a file to the server.
- **Request Parameters:** 
  - `file`: The file to be uploaded.
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK`: If the file is successfully uploaded.
  - `400 Bad Request`: If no file is provided or the file type is not allowed.

## Configuration

- **UPLOAD_FOLDER:** The directory where uploaded files will be saved (`uploads` by default).
- **MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH:** The maximum size for uploaded files (16 MB).

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the `secure_filename` function is used to sanitize file names and avoid directory traversal attacks.
- The API only accepts specific file types for added security.
